The Results at CSE549-Kmer-Estimate-parallel/Output_files have kmer abundance histogram information for different runs of the code.

The file names can be interpreted as follows:
out_<s(serial) / p(parallel)>[no. of threads in case of parallel]_k<value of k>_seq<file number of input sequence>

The directory also contains the input sequnces used, which are a subset from Human Chromosome 14 from Genome Assembly Gold-standard Evaluation (GAGE) data set.
